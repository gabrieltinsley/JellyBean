# JellyBean
Create a class called JellyBean with a main method.

In the main method, write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 51 (inclusive), but with a twist... some flavors of JellyBeans are disgusting.  
For any number that is even, print "Jelly" instead of the number. 
For multiples of 5, print "Bean" instead of the number. 
For numbers that are even and multiples of 5, print "Yuck!". 
Partial sample output is shown below. (Note: There are no command-line arguments and there should be no user input to the program).
